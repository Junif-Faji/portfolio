### Work Flow

The Design
-  The Electrical Control and Power Design revolves in the design of control system and power requirements for the STP
>insert image of CAD Design<
-  It includes Equipment Load Calculations, Single Line, Three-Line, Motor Control Ladder Diagram, and Motor Control Panel Layout. PLC Ladder includes on the projects that requires PLC automation, this excludes ladder diagram of the PLC program itself. It also include the sizing  and the design of Transformer, Generator, ATS, Switchgears (low voltage) and other electrical machineries required on site.

The Take-off
-  Creating Bills of Material/ Quantity for both Motor Control Panel Components (protection, controls, enclosure, tagging and other accessories) and Electrical Layout works (conduit, fittings, wires and cables, and support materials) for both electrical equipment and power supply.

The Coordination
-  My job includes coordinating with the supplier to request prices (creating Purchase Requisitions), obtain instrument manuals and operations, and address other project-related concerns

The Implementation (MCC Fabrication)
-  Before becoming an engineer in the Philippines, I graduated as an Electrical Technician and was trained to read diagrams and assemble motor control centers (MCC) and PLC panels. This training now helps me design MCCs and other electrical machinery with greater precision
- The implementation begins with the fabrication of MCCs and switchgear. Once the design and materials are approved, fabrication and assembly begin.

The Implementation (On-site)
- Some of my projects do not include on-site implementation, but some do. At various points in my career, I have been appointed as Project Supervisor/Project-in-Charge, successfully completing many projects. This experience has trained me to visualize and design projects more precisely, both for power and control systems.
-  On-site implementation involves management, client relations, supervision and implementing electrical works like stub-out provisions, rough-ins, wiring methods, and motor winding terminations. It also includes the methodology for more complex on-site installations.
